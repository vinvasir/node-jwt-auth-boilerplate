# node-jwt-auth-boilerplate
Creating a boilerplate for a Node + Express + Postgres API and a VueJS + Vue Router + Vuex front end. The front end is built with Webpack and uses the default configuration and API from Laravel Mix.

To get started, download, clone, or fork the repository.

Update the database configuration in './knefile.js' to match your database settings.

Update the database migration files to match your project requirements, and run `knex migrate:latest`

Install dependencies with ` npm install `

Build the front end code with ` npm run dev `. If you want live updates, use ` npm run watch ` or ` npm run hot `

Boot up the server with ` npm start `, and your full stack application will be ready to go!
